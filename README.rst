Prerequisites
-------------

To use this library, you'll need to create a free GeoIPify account:
https://geoipify.whoisxmlapi.com/

If you haven't done this yet, please do so now.


Installation
------------

To install ``flask-simple-geoip`` using `pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install flask-simple-geoip

In the root of your project directory.


Usage
-----

Once you have `flask-simple-geoip` installed, you can use it to easily find the
physical location of a given IP address.

This library gives you access to all sorts of geographical location data that
you can use in your application in any number of ways.

Here's a simple Flask app that makes use of the geolocation lookups:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask, jsonify
    from flask_simple_geoip import SimpleGeoIP


    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Initialize the extension
    simple_geoip = SimpleGeoIP(app)


    @app.route('/')
    def test():
        # Retrieve geoip data for the given requester
        geoip_data = simple_geoip.get_geoip_data()

        return jsonify(data=geoip_data)

Here's the sort of data you might get back when performing a geoip lookup
request:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "ip": "8.8.8.8",
      "location": {
        "country": "US",
        "region": "California",
        "city": "Mountain View",
        "lat": 37.40599,
        "lng": -122.078514,
        "postalCode": "94043",
        "timezone": "-08:00"
      }
    }

By default, this library handles retrying failed HTTP requests for you. For
instance: if the GeoIPify API service is currently down or having issues,
your request will be retried up to three consecutive times before failing.

In the event a geoip lookup still can't return successfully, the data returned
will be `None`. This library will *never* throw an exception. This decision was
made strategically: not having geoip data should never be the cause of a failed
request. =)
